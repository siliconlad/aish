# aish

A terminal shell which enables the use of regular text to specify actions to perform within a natural terminal, whilst also being backwards compatible with existing shells.

This is based on the idea that certain things are easy to do in the terminal

```bash
ls
```

Whilst others are better off with text descriptions of the intented outcome

```
Rename all png files in this directory with the format YYYY_MM_DD.png where the YYYY, MM and DD is the year, month and day when the file was created.
```

With LLMs, this now becomes possible.
